# Three directions of Moss

#### Fundamental Concepts

**Account**: An account on the blockchain represents a user, capable of sending or receiving transactions and interacting with other chain accounts. Currently, there are mainly two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (also known as "Smart Contract Accounts," with AA being a type of smart contract account). The primary purpose of an account is to verify your identity and sign transactions.

**Wallet**: A wallet is software, hardware, or an online tool for managing accounts.

In the current web3 context, the above two are often mixed up and considered as one concept.

**Dapp**: A single application based on blockchain decentralization and smart contracts.

In Moss's definition, the direction can be divided into three main categories. In both the real world and web2, accounts and wallets are two different concepts. Moss separates these two concepts in web3 as well.

1. **Abstract Account (AA)** The core concept of AA can be summarized into two key points: Signature Abstraction and Gas Abstraction. The former allows various account contracts to use different signature verification schemes (such as EOA's single private key signature, multi-signature aggregation, social wallets, social recovery, etc.) to verify transactions or even multiple transactions at once. The latter mainly provides multiple currency options for transaction fee payment or substitute payment. Existing AA wallets are only implemented based on these two directions + Builder service direction. Features similar to abstract account Can refer to WeChat's account and security page, mainly refers to account login, account registration, password setting, fingerprint recognition, voice recognition, binding mobile phones, emails, emergency contacts, etc.
2. **Abstract Wallet** Asset management abstraction, payment abstraction, identity verification and personal information abstraction, cross-chain asset management abstraction Features similar to abstract account Wallet real-world example In real life, a wallet is an item or tool used for storing, managing, and conducting currency transactions. Its significance includes the following aspects: Currency storage and management: A wallet is where people store paper money, coins, and other forms of currency. It allows individuals to carry a certain amount of cash for daily expenses and purchasing goods and services. Payment tool: Wallets usually include credit cards, debit cards, and other payment cards, enabling individuals to make electronic payments. These cards can be used with POS terminals, ATMs, etc., for convenient shopping and cash withdrawal. Identity verification and personal information: Wallets typically contain personal ID cards, driving licenses, membership cards, health cards, and other important identity and personal information documents. These documents are used for identity verification when needed. Receipts and tickets: People usually store important receipts such as shopping receipts, invoices, tickets, etc., in their wallets for future reference and record. Personal items and photos: Some people keep family photos, small mementos, or other personal items in their wallets to carry with them and display. Financial management: Wallets are not just places for storing money, but can also be used for financial management. People can record expenses, budgets, credit card bills, and bank statements in their wallets to better manage personal finances. Style and personality: Wallets are often a reflection of an individual's taste and style. People can choose from various styles and materials of wallets based on their preferences. Overall, wallets play a very important role in real life. They are not only financial tools but also places for identity verification and personal information storage, reflecting personal taste and style. With the rise of digital payments and electronic identity verification, traditional paper wallets have gradually evolved into digital wallets and mobile applications, but their basic functions and significance remain. Can also refer to the WeChat wallet page.
3. **Dapp Store and Own Dapp (Dapp Store)** Users build their Own DApp through the Dapp Store (decentralized application, intermediary-free Dapp). They are not limited to a specific blockchain or smart contract platform but aim to achieve broader functionality and interoperability. It also does not limit the number of Own Dapps. They are upgradeable, combinable, expandable, and modularly manageable. It is for other users to use externally, and since the user itself is upgradeable and can initiate transactions, it is only suitable for Dapps that do not need to manage external user assets. Dapp Store similar features Refer to WeChat Mini Programs, accessing Mini Programs does not require upgrading WeChat itself. The difference from WeChat is that Mini Programs are managed by the server of the Mini Program development company, while Moss's Own Dapp is completely controlled and managed by the user themselves.
