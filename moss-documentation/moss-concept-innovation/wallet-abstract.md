In the real world, a wallet serves as a tool for storing and managing currency transactions. It plays a significant role in multiple aspects:

1. Currency storage and management: A wallet allows individuals to store and carry paper money, coins, and other forms of currency for daily expenses and purchasing goods and services.
2. Payment tool: Wallets often include payment cards like credit cards and debit cards, enabling electronic payments through POS terminals, ATMs, and other means.
3. Identity verification and personal information: Wallets typically hold personal ID cards, driving licenses, membership cards, health cards, and other important identity documents for verification purposes.
4. Receipts and tickets: Important receipts, shopping records, invoices, tickets, and similar items can be stored in a wallet for future reference.
5. Personal items and photos: Some individuals keep personal mementos, family photos, or other sentimental items in their wallets as keepsakes.
6. Financial management: Wallets can be used for financial management, allowing users to record expenses, budgets, credit card bills, and bank statements to better manage their finances.
7. Style and personality: Wallets are often chosen based on personal style and preferences, reflecting an individual's taste and personality.

### Wallet Abstract

In the digital realm, traditional paper wallets have transformed into digital wallets and mobile applications, while retaining their fundamental functions and significance. However, wallet abstraction in the context of web3 and digital ecosystems involves the abstraction of various functionalities beyond traditional currency management and payment. It includes asset management, cross-chain asset management, payment abstraction, and identity verification, and personal information abstraction.

Thus wallet abstraction refers to a concept that encompasses various functionalities such as asset management, payment abstraction, identity verification, and personal information abstraction within a digital ecosystem.

It is important to note that in Moss's definition, accounts and wallets are considered as distinct concepts both in the real world and in web2. This distinction is maintained in the web3 context as well.&#x20;
