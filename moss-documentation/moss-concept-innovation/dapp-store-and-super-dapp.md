# Dapp Store and Super Dapp

**Dapp Store：**Users build their Own DApp through the Dapp Store (decentralized application, intermediary-free Dapp). They are not limited to a specific blockchain or smart contract platform but aim to achieve broader functionality and interoperability. It also does not limit the number of Own Dapps. They are upgradeable, combinable, expandable, and modularly manageable. It is for other users to use externally, and since the user itself is upgradeable and can initiate transactions, it is only suitable for Dapps that do not need to manage external user assets. Dapp Store similar features Refer to WeChat Mini Programs, accessing Mini Programs does not require upgrading WeChat itself. The difference from WeChat is that Mini Programs are managed by the server of the Mini Program development company, while Moss's Own Dapp is completely controlled and managed by the user themselves.



**Super Dapp is a way for users to have multiple Own Dapps and effectively manage them.** Each user can freely add, delete, and update their Own Dapps, and these applications can be combined and modularly managed as needed.

To ensure the security and reliability of Own Dapp, the Moss team has developed a protocol standard called SNIP-62, which defines the interface for managing and modularizing Own Dapp. A system that implements this protocol standard is called the Super Dapp. The Super Dapp provides a user-friendly interface and functionalities that enable users to easily manage their Own Dapp.



**At the same time, to ensure the quality and security of Own Dapp, Moss introduces the concept of a Dapp Store.** The Dapp Store is an application store where users can access Own Dapp that can be added to the Super Dapp. Similar to the iOS App Store, Moss’s Dapp Store only allows the addition of audited Moss Dapp, ensuring user safety and providing income guarantees for Moss Dapp developers.

In summary, Super Dapp is a platform for users to manage and customize their Own Dapp, which are personalized decentralized applications created and owned by users themselves. The Super Dapp provides a user-friendly interface and functionalities for managing multiple Own Dapp in a modular manner.
