# Active Asset Transfer

#### Active Asset Transfer

For example: Alice transferring assets to Bob. This involves three roles: owner Alice, asset token, and recipient Bob.

How to ensure that there are no obstacles on the way of Alice transferring assets and that they can be successfully transferred to Bob?

```
   --> Blockchain-based ERC20, ERC721, and programmable assets ensure the security of asset transfers.

```

Shortcomings:

For example, Alice cannot manage how to transfer to and receive from others, such as limiting the amount she can transfer at a time, checking if the receiving address is a black hole contract address, or if the address belongs to a blacklist.

New solution:

Alice manages how to transfer using the MOSS asset management module, which provides the interface for asset transfer.
