Moss has realized the vision of users owning their [Own Dapp](../../moss-documentation/moss-concept-innovation/own-dapp.md) and its management interface by introducing concepts such as Account Abstraction, Wallet Abstraction, Own Dapp, [Super Dapp](https://app.gitbook.com/o/J2hnVZ1TebdQeuvrt36W/s/26N8XsdT8yfk4SxjWi2t/\~/changes/10/moss-concept-innovation/dapp-store-and-super-dapp), and [Dapp Store](https://app.gitbook.com/o/J2hnVZ1TebdQeuvrt36W/s/26N8XsdT8yfk4SxjWi2t/\~/changes/10/moss-concept-innovation/dapp-store-and-super-dapp).&#x20;
