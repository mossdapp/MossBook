In the world of blockchain and decentralized technologies, Moss is a project with a clear vision to revolutionize the way we interact with assets and applications.&#x20;



**1Ô∏è. Defining a New Asset Structure**

Moss aims to create a new asset structure that prioritizes security, customizability, and technical friendliness. This stateless structure ensures compatibility with existing assets, allowing for seamless integration and a smooth transition.



**2Ô∏è. Abstract Wallet Concept**

Moss introduces the concept of an abstract wallet that goes beyond traditional wallets. It includes features like identity authentication and Decentralized Identifiers (DID). This enhances security and gives users a robust and trustless foundation for their digital identities.



**3Ô∏è. New Value Interactions**&#x20;

With Moss, users can unleash the power of their own decentralized applications (Own Dapps). Moss enables personalized and seamless value interactions by eliminating intermediaries and fostering trustlessness, empowering users like never before.



**4Ô∏è. Dapp Store**

Moss innovates the concept of Dapp store, offering a wide array of secure and trustworthy Own Dapps. Explore a world of endless possibilities and enjoy a diverse and engaging experience while ensuring compatibility and avoiding conflicts.



**5Ô∏è. Lowering User Entry Barrier**

Moss aims to simplify user access with the Passkey concept. Say goodbye to complex setups and processes. Moss lowers the entry barrier, making it easier for users to embrace the decentralized ecosystem and unlock its benefits.



**6Ô∏è. Decentralized Front-End for User Applications**

Moss provides a decentralized front-end solution for user applications. Seamlessly integrate decentralized experiences into Own Dapp and empower users with enhanced privacy, security, and control.



**7Ô∏è. Moss for Business and DAO**

Moss is designed to facilitate easy upgrades, unified asset management, gas savings, and support for a wide range of applications. It offers a superior design, making it a promising choice for businesses and decentralized autonomous organizations (Dao).



Moss represents the future of Web3 innovation, where assets are secure, customizable, and easily accessible to everyone, and value interaction is integrated into Own Dapp. It paves the way for a decentralized and user-centric ecosystem that fosters trust, efficiency, and limitless possibilities.
