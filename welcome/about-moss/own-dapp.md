# Own Dapp

\
The development of the Internet has brought various centralized applications that facilitate value exchange for users. These applications support asset delegation, where users need to trust the applications and delegate their assets for management, such as PayPal, Coinbase, and others. However, with the emergence of blockchain technology, decentralized features were achieved through designs like Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism, enabling asset transfers without the need to delegate assets to applications. **This concept of “own asset” allowed users to truly own their assets.**

Similarly, smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Starknet enabled the decentralization of applications, resulting in the birth of decentralized applications (Dapps). However, to date, when users interact with users, they still need to trust them and delegate or authorize their assets. For example, third-party applications like Uniswap and Opensea.

To further achieve decentralization and disintermediation, it is necessary to allow users to directly interact or transact within their Dapps without delegating or authorizing assets to third-party Dapps. **When intermediaries are eliminated, users truly own their applications. This is where the concept of Own Dapp comes in.**&#x20;

**Own Dapp refers to Dapps owned and managed by users, where the state and data storage are controlled by the users themselves.** Own Dapp provides a new way of interaction, allowing users to interact more securely, free from intermediaries, and offering more programmable application options.



**Own Dapp is a new type of asset,** it can be traded as nft.
