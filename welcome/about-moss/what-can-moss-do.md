# What can Moss do?

Moss is a **Super Dapp** that utilizes account abstraction and provides users with the ability to create their Own Dapps.&#x20;

These **Own Dapps** have similar functionality to existing Dapps in the market, such as asset management, Dex, lending, NFT marketplace, and more. The key difference is that Own Dapps are owned and managed by users, with users having control over the state and data storage.

To ensure security and maintain a high standard of quality, Moss introduces the concept of a **Dapp Store**. Only audited Own Dapps that meet the necessary criteria can be published on the platform. This allows users to freely add, delete, and update their Own Dapps as needed while ensuring a trusted and secure environment.

By combining and modularly managing Own Dapps, Moss offers flexibility and empowers users to tailor their Dapp experience according to their preferences and requirements.
