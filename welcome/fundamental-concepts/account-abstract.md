# Account Abstract

**Account Abstract (AA) is a term used in the blockchain context, referring to the separation of fund control from the execution of smart contracts.** It allows users to abstract the control of their funds into different accounts while independently executing smart contracts. This separation provides flexibility in managing funds and executing contract logic, enhancing security and enabling more advanced transaction capabilities within the blockchain ecosystem.

**Account Abstract encompasses two crucial elements: Signature Abstraction and Gas Abstraction.**&#x20;

**Signature Abstraction** is a feature that empowers different account contracts to employ diverse signature verification methods. This includes options such as single private key signature, multi-signature aggregation, social wallets, and social recovery. By supporting various signature schemes, AA enables the verification of transactions, even when multiple transactions are involved.

**Gas Abstraction** is another key component of AA. It provides users with multiple currency options for paying transaction fees or alternative forms of payment. This flexibility allows individuals to choose their preferred currency for transaction costs, enhancing convenience and usability within the blockchain network.

Account abstract wallets, which are currently available, are primarily built on the foundation of these two principles, along with the inclusion of the Builder service component. These wallets leverage Signature Abstraction and Gas Abstraction to provide users with advanced features and capabilities for managing their accounts and engaging in transactions.

In conclusion, Account Abstract (AA) introduces Signature Abstraction and Gas Abstraction as fundamental elements in the blockchain field. Utilizing these principles, Abstract wallets offer enhanced functionality and provide users with a range of features for managing their accounts.&#x20;
