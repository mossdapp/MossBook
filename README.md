# ℹ️ About Moss

**Moss** is a modular smart contract wallet. Moss's **native passkey** greatly simplifies user operations and improves security, while Moss' **Own Dapp** allows anyone to easily launch their own applications.

Moss supports the next-generation scalable wallet architecture—**modular smart contract wallets**.

From an account perspective, Moss supports native passkey accounts that do not require users to download mobile apps, install extensions, or use mnemonic phrases. It is based on biometrics or hardware security modules, making it safer and more convenient.

From an application perspective, Moss extends functionality by separating application state from logic and introduces a wallet's Own dapp management mechanism, allowing users to truly own their applications.

Interestingly, Own dapp is a **more decentralized** application that does not perform worse on-chain than traditional dapps. Instead, it can alleviate the state explosion issue and aligns with the trend of parallel transaction execution in sorters, thus enhancing the chain's performance.
