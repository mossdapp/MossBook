# ℹ️ About Moss

Everyone considers wallets as the gateway to the Web3 world, allowing access to various external dapps. However, the Moss team views wallets not merely as gateways, At the same time, the wallet itself is the container of dapp. Moss is the first project to introduce the concept of Own Dapp, enabling every user to have their own dapp.

From an account perspective, Moss supports native passkey accounts that do not require users to download mobile apps, install extensions, or use mnemonic phrases. It is based on biometrics or hardware security modules, making it safer and more convenient.

From an application perspective, Moss extends functionality by separating application state from logic and introduces a wallet's Own dapp management mechanism, allowing users to truly own their applications.

Interestingly, Own dapp is a **more decentralized** application that does not perform worse on-chain than traditional dapps. Instead, it can alleviate the state explosion issue and aligns with the trend of parallel transaction execution in sorters, thus enhancing the chain's performance.
